```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(fivethirtyeight)
library(lintr)

# Loading the tidyverse and fivethirtyeight packages because the pset said I would need them. Loading lintr because the tidyverse style guide said it would perform automated checks to make sure I was conforming to the style guide, and I anticipate needing help to not lose points on style issues.
